    "### Background\n",
    "MD5 was once the most widely used cryptographic hash function, but today it is considered dangerously insecure. This is because cryptanalysts have discovered efficient algorithms for finding collisions—pairs of messages with the same MD5 hash value. The first known collisions were announced on August 17, 2004, by Xiaoyun Wang, Dengguo Feng, Xuejia Lai, and Hongbo Yu. \n",

    "In 2004, Wang’s method took more than 5 hours to find a collision on a desktop PC. Since then, researchers have introduced vastly more efficient collision-finding algorithms. You can compute your own MD5 collisions using a tool written by Marc Stevens that uses a more advanced technique.\n",

    "## A Hash Collision Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "The collision attack lets us generate two messages with the same MD5 hash and any chosen (identical) prefix. Due to MD5’s length-extension behavior, we can append any suffix to both messages and know that the longer messages will also collide. This lets us construct files that differ only in a binary “blob” in the middle and have the same MD5 hash, i.e., `prefix || blobA || suffix` and `prefix || blobB || suffix`. \n",
