    "\n",
    "## Task Description\n",
    "You are required to demonstrate the avalanche effect by using two strings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **3.1_input_string.txt**: Original string\n",
    "2. **3.1_perturbed_string.txt**: Perturbed string (an exact copy of the original string with one bit flipped)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "We will generate the SHA-256 hash of both strings and count how many bits are different in the two results (a.k.a. the Hamming distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Figure 1\n",
    "Avalanche effect: When a single bit is changed, the hash sum becomes completely different. (Image source: Wikipedia)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Steps to Complete\n",
    "1. **Generate SHA-256 Hashes**:\n",
    "   - Compute the SHA-256 hashes for both strings.\n",
    "   - Verify that the hashes are different.\n",
    "   - You can use the following command:\n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     openssl dgst -sha256 3.1_input_string.txt 3.1_perturbed_string.txt\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compute Hamming Distance**:\n",
    "   - Calculate the number of bits that are different between the two hash outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Submit Result**:\n",
    "   - Write the Hamming distance as a hex string in the file `solution31.hex`.\n"

    "One example of when length extension causes a serious vulnerability is when people mistakenly try to construct something like an HMAC by using hash (`secret || k || message`), where `k` indicates concatenation. \n",

    "### Task\n",
    "Text files with the query of the URL **3.3_query.txt** and the command line to append **3.3_command3.txt** are provided. Using the techniques that you learned in the lectures and without guessing the password, apply length extension to create a new query in the URL ending with command specified in the file, `&command3=DeleteAllFiles`, that is treated as valid by the server.\n",

    "**Historical fact**: In 2009, security researchers found that the API used by the photo-sharing site Flickr suffered from a length-extension vulnerability almost exactly like the one in this exercise.\n",

    "- Submit a Python script named **len_ext_attack.py**.\n",
    "- Submit a text file named **solution33.txt** that should contain the updated query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Script Requirements\n",
    "Your Python script should perform the following:\n",
    "1. Modify the query so that it will execute the `DeleteAllFiles` command as the user. \n",
    "2. Verify that your length extension works.\n"
